# bettervods
All in one Twitch downloader + converter + video player.

Twitch vods are really bad for vod reviewing, so I wrote this to give them a more Youtube-like feel. Hope you enjoy it
This originally started as a website but doing file conversion in the browser is horrible, so now its a desktop app.

## Installation
1. Downlad [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). This **WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT IT**
2. Download and install the latest release [here](https://github.com/nerdyfitzy/bettervods-rs/releases/tag/latest)

## Information and known bugs
- The "Go to VODs folder" button doesn't work. VODs are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/bettervods/vods`
- Timestamps aren't saved between sessions
